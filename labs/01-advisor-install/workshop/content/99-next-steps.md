# Next Steps

Congratulations on completing the Spring Application Advisor workshop! Here are some recommendations for continuing your journey.

## Practice and Experimentation

### Try It on a Test Project First

Before using Spring Application Advisor on production code:

1. **Create a test branch:**
   ```execute
   git checkout -b test-spring-advisor
   ```

2. **Run the full upgrade process:**
   ```execute
   ./advisor build-config get
   ```
   ```execute
   ./advisor upgrade-plan get
   ```
   ```execute
   ./advisor upgrade-plan apply
   ```

3. **Review the changes thoroughly:**
   ```execute
   git diff
   ```

4. **Test your application:**
   - Run all unit tests
   - Run integration tests
   - Perform manual testing
   - Check for deprecation warnings

### Start with Smaller Projects

Build confidence by starting with:

- Microservices with fewer dependencies
- Internal tools or utilities
- Non-critical applications
- Projects with good test coverage

## Integrate into Your Development Workflow
