# Spring Application Advisor Workshop

An [Educates](https://educates.dev) workshop for learning how to install and use the Spring Application Advisor CLI to upgrade Spring Boot applications.

## About Spring Application Advisor

Spring Application Advisor is a native CLI tool that helps you upgrade Spring applications by:

- Analyzing your project's build dependencies and tools
- Creating step-by-step upgrade plans
- Applying upgrades automatically while preserving your code style

The CLI supports two main commands:
- `build-config` - Analyzes project build dependencies and tools
- `upgrade-plan` - Retrieves or applies upgrade plans to your project
